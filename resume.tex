		\vspace{-0.8em}
		\item \textbf{Software Engineer} {Bankwest / Commonwealth Bank of Australia} \hfill Feb 2021 - Present
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Developed instant "on-upload" Naive Bayes machine learning model within Java Spring Boot that lifted auto-categorisation recall (true-positive) rates of critical bank documents from 42.7\% up to a rate of 90\%. This led to a significant decrease in manual categorisation and subsequently resulted in a nomination for a national individual excellence award at my parent company
			\item "Stream Lead" on developing Bankwest's first LLM powered broker chat application, which was delivered to production in two months (fastest greenfield project in bank history). The role involved technical design and development on the creation of a Java Spring Boot API and an Angular frontend that consumed SSE events from streamed LLM output
			\item Technical Owner on two internal tools that automated the tracking of tech health and lead time to change metrics
for hundreds of systems bankwide. This allowed technology executives to easily find reporting on the health of their systems
through a UI interface		
			\item Developed and led multiple learning initiatives for 30+ graduates, including monthly tech talks, knowledge documentation, and a book club
			\item \textbf{Awards}: Hack Day Winner (2024), National Individual Excellence Award Nominee (2024) 
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Software Engineer (Student)} {Australian Bureau of Statistics} \hfill Nov 2020 - Feb 2021

	\begin{rSection}{Projects and Other Work}
		\vspace{-0.8em}
		\item \textbf{LLM Powered Chinese Reading Application} 
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Application developed using Next.js and Python that uses OpenAI large language models to generate custom Chinese learning material, pronunciation and translations for the user's exact fluency level based on previously known vocabulary
			\item Developed custom asynchronous LLM chaining request strategy with Python asyncio to optimise serving of per word and sentence Chinese to English translations (20-30s total response time)
		\end{itemize}
