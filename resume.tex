	\begin{rSection}{Work History}
		\vspace{-0.8em}
		\item \textbf{Software Engineer} {Bankwest / Commonwealth Bank of Australia} \hfill Feb 2021 - Current
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Developed instant "on-upload" Naive Bayes machine learning model within Java Spring Boot that lifted auto-categorisation recall (true-positive) rates of critical bank documents from 42.7\% up to a rate of 90\%. This led to a significant decrease in reliance on back-office manual categorisation while maintaining optimal user experience. This achievement subsequently resulted in a nomination for a national individual excellence award at my parent company.
			\item Designated as "Stream Lead" on developing Bankwest's first LLM powered broker chat application with a deadline of two months (fastest greenfield project in bank history). The role involved interfacing with an external engineering team to align on technical details and architecture, as well as leading the team to consume the streamed LLM output to a Java Spring Boot API and subsequently forwarding SSE Events to be consumed by an Angular Frontend.
			\item Technical Owner on two internal tools that automated the tracking of tech health and lead time to change metrics
for hundreds of systems bankwide. This allowed technology executives to easily find reporting on the health of their systems
through a UI interface.		
			\item Developed 3 key learning initiatives for 30+ technology graduates including organising a monthly talk from
a senior technology colleague, a central document to describe bankwide technologies and being a founding
member of a software engineering book club
			\item \textbf{Awards}: Hack Day Winner (2024), National Individual Excellence Award Nominee (2024) 
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{HPC IT Officer} {DownUnder Geosolutions} \hfill Jan 2018 - Oct 2019
		\begin{itemize} 

			\item  Diagnosed and repaired networking and performance issues with underperforming High-Performance Computers in the 600+ node machine room
		\end{itemize}

		\vspace{-0.8em}
		\item \textbf{LLM based Chinese Reading Application} {\hfill \faIcon[regular]{link} https://language-learning-app-ui-production.up.railway.app/}  
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item LLM powered Chinese Language Learning Application (Next.js, React, Python) that generates streamed chinese learning material, pronounciation and translations for the user's exact level based on previously known vocabulary.
			\item Developed real-time asynchronous LLM request strategy with python asyncio to serve per word and per sentence Chinese to english translations at a reasonable response time (20-30s total response time). 
		\end{itemize}
